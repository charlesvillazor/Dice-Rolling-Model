# Dice-Rolling-Model
MATLAB scripts that produce a simulation of dice rolling (actual physical dice rolling, not just pulling two numbers randomly).
This was the final project of my MAE 361 - Dynamics and Controls class where we learned about vibrational analysis and classical control theory.
The ProjectFinalScript.m is the main script of the simulation, and the rest of the scripts are used as functions to refer back to.
The sides and amount of dice are configurable, although it's quite hard for a proper simulation to occur with >3 dice on the screen at the same time.
This also uses the main concepts of state space and numerical integration, however all the equations to model the physical system were made by me.
The entirety of the scripts were made using MATLAB.
